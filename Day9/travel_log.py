# # Dictionary in List

# Instructions

# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log.
# You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.

# Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 11
# to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.

# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])

# > `You've visited Russia 2 times.`

# > `You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.`

# **DO NOT** modify the travel_log directly.
# You need to create a function that modifies it.

# Hint

# 1. Look at the function call above to see what the name of the function
#   should be.

# 2. The inputs for the function are positional arguments.
#     The order is very important.

# 3. Feel free to choose your own parameter names.


travel_log = [
    {
      "country": "France",
      "visits": 12,
      "cities": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"]
    },
    {
      "country": "Germany",
      "visits": 5,
      "cities": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
    },
]
# ðŸš¨ Do NOT change the code above


def add_new_country(country_name, times_visited, list_of_cities_visited):
    travel_log.append({'country': country_name,
                       'visits': times_visited,
                       'cities': list_of_cities_visited})
