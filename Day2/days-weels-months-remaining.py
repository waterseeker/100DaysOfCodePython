## Your Life in Weeks

# Instructions

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, 
# weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 

# It will take your current age as the input and output a message 
# with our time left in this format:
#     > You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers. 
# Assume there are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year, and 12 months 
# in a year. Ignore leap years for this exercise.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
years_left = 90 - int(age)
days_left = years_left * 365
weeks_left = years_left * 52
months_left = years_left * 12

print(f"You have {days_left} days, {weeks_left} weeks, and {months_left} months left. ")
