# ## BMI Calculator 2.0

# # Instructions

# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# - Under 18.5 they are underweight
# - Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# - Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# - Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# - Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

# **Warning** you should **round** the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above. e.g. **underweight, normal weight,  overweight, obese, clinically obese**. 

# # Example Input

# ```
# weight = 85
# ```

# ```
# height = 1.75
# ```

# # Example Output

# 85 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) =  27.755102040816325

# ```
# Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
# ```

# e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:

# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

# ```
# "Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."
# "Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."
# "Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."
# "Your BMI is 33, you are obese."
# "Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."
# ```

# Hint

# 1. Try to use the **exponent** operator in your code.
# 2. Remember to **round** your result to the nearest whole number. 
# 3. Make sure you include the words in **bold** from the interpretations.
