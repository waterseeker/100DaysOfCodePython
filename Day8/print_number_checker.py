## Prime Numbers

# Instructions

# Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by itself and 1. 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number

# **You need to write a function** that checks whether if the number passed into 
# it is a prime number or not.

# e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

# But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

# Here are the numbers up to 100, prime numbers are highlighted in yellow:

# Example Input 1
# 73

# Example Output 1
# It's a prime number.

# Example Input 2
# 75

# Example Output 2
# It's not a prime number.

# Hint

# 1. Remember the modulus:

# 2. Make sure you name your function/parameters the same as when it's called 
# on the last line of code. 

# 3. Use the same wording as the Example Outputs to make sure the tests pass.
